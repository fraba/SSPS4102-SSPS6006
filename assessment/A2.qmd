## Overview

This assessment comprises 10 brief weekly interactive coding exercises that develop your practical R programming skills and ability to interpret statistical output. Each exercise combines hands-on coding practice with written interpretation of R results, reinforcing the connection between code, output, and statistical meaning. Unlike Assessment 1, these exercises are completed outside of class during the week at your own pace.

**Weight:** 20% of final grade

## Format

- **Number of quizzes:** 13 weeks of offering; you must complete **10 of 13** to achieve 100% for this assessment
- **Structure:** Most weeks consist of 2–3 component parts within a single interactive tutorial
- **Delivery:** Online interactive tutorial completed via your browser at any time during the week
- **Time allocation:** Up to 45 minutes per week
- **Completion:** Completed outside of scheduled class sessions

## Completion and Submission

Each tutorial part will generate a **completion certificate** (PDF) upon successful submission. To complete the assessment for any given week, you are required to:

1. Complete all tutorial parts for that week online
2. Download the PDF completion certificate for **each part**
3. Upload **all certificates** to Canvas by **Sunday 11:59 pm** of the current week

::: callout-note
### Important

If a week consists of 2–3 parts, you must submit 2–3 certificates respectively. A week is only marked as complete when all part certificates have been uploaded.
:::

### Timing

You have the flexibility to complete these exercises at any time during the week. However, all certificates must be uploaded by Sunday 11:59 pm to be counted towards this assessment.

## Marking

- Each completed weekly submission (all parts) = **10 points**
- Maximum grade for this assessment = **100 points** (10 submissions × 10 points)
- To receive full marks (100%), you must submit all certificates for a minimum of **10 of the 13 weeks**
- Late submissions beyond the Sunday 11:59 pm deadline will not be accepted without justification. If you require an extension, you must provide a justification via email and add a comment to the Canvas submission page

## What These Exercises Assess

These exercises are designed to develop your ability to:

- Write functional R code to manipulate and analyse data
- Interpret R output in the context of statistical concepts
- Apply weekly learning objectives through practical coding tasks
- Develop reproducible research practices
