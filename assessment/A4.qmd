### Draft

This assessment description is still in **draft form** and may be slightly revised before Week 01.
:::

## Overview

In this assessment, you will conduct a complete data analysis project — from identifying a dataset and formulating a research question to statistical modelling and communication of findings. This is a capstone project that draws on all of the skills developed throughout the semester: data acquisition, cleaning, visualisation, descriptive analysis, and regression modelling.

**Weight:** 40% of final grade

**Length:** 1,500 words (as measured in the Quarto source document, excluding code)

## Task

You will **find your own dataset** on a topic that interests you, formulate a research question, and answer it using one or more regression models. Your analysis should go beyond description and investigate the **relationship** between an outcome of interest and one or more predictor variables.

### Requirements

1. **Choose a dataset.** Find a publicly available dataset relevant to social science research. The dataset must:
    - Contain at least **200 observations**.
    - Include at least **one plausible outcome variable** (continuous or binary) and **two or more potential predictor variables**.
    - Be available in a format you can import into R (e.g., `.csv`, `.sav`, `.xlsx`, `.dta`, `.rds`).

2. **Formulate a research question.** Your research question should be clear, specific, and answerable with the data you have chosen. It should concern the relationship between variables — not simply describe a single variable.

3. **Prepare the data.** Import, inspect, clean, and recode your variables as necessary. Handle missing values appropriately and justify your decisions.

4. **Fit at least one regression model.** Depending on your outcome variable, fit an appropriate model:
    - If your outcome is continuous, use **linear regression** (`lm()`).
    - If your outcome is binary, use **logistic regression** (`glm()` with `family = binomial`).

5. **Present and interpret your results.** Report coefficients, standard errors, and measures of model fit. Interpret your findings in substantive terms.

### Choosing a good dataset

Pick a dataset and a question that genuinely interest you — your engagement with the topic will show in the quality of your analysis. Avoid datasets that are already heavily cleaned and packaged as textbook exercises (e.g., `mtcars`, `iris`). The goal is to demonstrate your ability to work with real-world data.

### Tip

If you are unsure whether a dataset is suitable, check with Francesco before the submission date.

## Report structure

Your report should include the following sections.

### 1. Introduction

Introduce your research question and explain why it is interesting or relevant. Briefly describe the dataset: its source, what it covers, the unit of observation, and the number of observations.

### 2. Data and variables

For each variable (outcome and predictors):

- Describe what the variable measures.
- Report descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, frequency distributions as appropriate).
- Discuss any recoding or transformations applied, and explain why these were necessary.
- Include at least one visualisation that helps the reader understand the data (e.g., distributions, cross-tabulations, or bivariate relationships).

### 3. Model and results

- Specify the regression model(s) you estimated and justify your modelling choices.
- Present the regression output in a well-formatted table (e.g., using the `modelsummary` package or `knitr::kable()`).
- Interpret the key coefficients in substantive terms. For example: *"A one-unit increase in X is associated with a Y-unit change in the outcome, holding other variables constant."*
- Discuss the overall model fit (e.g., R-squared for linear regression; pseudo R-squared for logistic regression).

### 4. Discussion and conclusion

- Summarise your main findings in relation to your research question.
- Discuss the limitations of your analysis (e.g., potential confounders, measurement issues, generalisability).
- Suggest possible directions for further research.

::: callout-note
### Important

All code must be visible in your final PDF (`echo: true`). Your report must be fully reproducible — that is, it must render without errors from the `.qmd` source file and the data included in your project folder.
:::

::: callout-tip
### Tip: Interpreting coefficients

Remember that regression coefficients from observational data should be interpreted as **associations**, not as causal effects. When discussing your results, use language such as *"is associated with"* or *"predicts"* rather than *"causes"* or *"leads to"*.
:::

## R programming tips

### Importing data

Depending on your file format, you may need one of the following:

```r
# CSV files
my_data <- read.csv("my_data.csv")

# SPSS files (.sav)
library(haven)
my_data <- read_sav("my_data.sav")

# Stata files (.dta)
library(haven)
my_data <- read_dta("my_data.dta")

# Excel files (.xlsx)
library(readxl)
my_data <- read_excel("my_data.xlsx")
```

### Fitting a linear regression model

```r
model_linear <- lm(outcome ~ var1 + var2 + var3,
                   data = my_data)
summary(model_linear)
```

### Fitting a logistic regression model

If your outcome variable is binary (e.g., 1 = yes, 0 = no):

```r
model_logistic <- glm(outcome ~ var1 + var2 + var3,
                      data = my_data,
                      family = binomial)
summary(model_logistic)
```

### Presenting regression results in a table

The `modelsummary` package produces clean, publication-style regression tables:

```r
library(modelsummary)

modelsummary(model_linear,
             stars = TRUE,
             title = "Predictors of outcome variable")
```

You can also compare multiple models side by side:

```r
modelsummary(list("Model 1" = model1, "Model 2" = model2),
             stars = TRUE)
```

::: callout-tip
### Tip

Remember to load all required packages at the top of your `.qmd` document. You will likely need `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `modelsummary`, plus whichever package you need to import your data (e.g., `haven`, `readxl`, `readr`).
:::

## Submission

You are expected to submit the following items on Canvas:

1. **Your report** — Render your report into a **PDF** from the source `.qmd` document. Ensure that all code chunks have `echo: true` so that your R code is visible in the final PDF.

2. **Your R project folder** — Compress your project folder into a `.zip` file. The folder must include:
    - Your `.qmd` source document
    - The data file
    - Your `.Rproj` file

::: callout-note
### Important

Late submissions beyond the deadline will not be accepted without justification. If you require an extension, you must provide a justification via email and add a comment to the Canvas submission page.
