## Individual causal effect vs Average causal effect

.content-box-yellow[

Casual inference is about answering "**WHAT IF?**" questions...

]

* What if Joe Biden (instead of Hillary Clinton) run against Donald Trump in 2016?

When we ask this question, we are interested in the net **effect** of some **intervention** on some **outcome**. 

* What if we pay teacher more? Will it have an effect on students' outcomes?

.content-box-red[

Yet, there is a problem, we can't pay `\(teacher_{Emily}\)` both *more* and *less* so to measure its effect.

]

---

### A counterfactual world, clearly, does not exist ...

.content-box-purple[

It is therefore **impossible** to measure an **individual casual effect**, because `\(teacher_{Emily}\)` is either paid more **or** less.

]

Yet still estimate an **average** causal effect within a population of interest (e.g., NSW teachers) -- and at the end of the day, it is often what we are really interested in.

- We do this by comparing different **samples** (i.e., groups) drawn from the same **population**. 

.content-box-yellow[

1. If sampling is random ( `\(teacher_{Emily}\)` has the same probability of being assigned to any group) and 

2. If we control the treatment (and we randomly assign it to some group only)

]

We can measure an Average Casual (a.k.a. Treatment) Effect on some outcome variable of interest.

---

### Individual causal effect vs Average causal effect

- We will never now the effect of a change in pay for `\(teacher_{Emily}\)` 
  
  - (.content-box-red[individual causal effect]);

- But we can know the effect of a change in pay for `\(teacher_i\)`, where `\(teacher_i = \{Emily, ... (\text{and all the other teachers in NSW})\}\)`

  - (.content-box-yellow[average casual effect])

---

## Association inference vs Causal inference

Why we know that some treatment or intervention (i.e., *higher* salary for teachers) has **caused** an increase in some outcome ( *higher* student performance)?

Because we have run a **randomised experiment** where

1. Individuals (teachers) were **randomly assigned** to one of at least two groups (higher or lower pay);

2. Treatment (higher pay) was (consequentially) also **assigned randomly** to one of the group. 

Randomness allows us to protect the measurement of the effect (i.e., difference-in-means) from other factors that might have influenced the relationship `\(treatement \rightarrow outcome\)`.

.content-box-yellow[

Without this control, the difference-in-means doesn't allow for a **causal inference** but an **association inference**.

## Does Social Pressure Affect Turnout?

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/vote.jpg' width = '45%'&gt;]

.footnote[Based on [Alan S. Gerber, Donald P. Green, and Christopher W. Larimer. 2008. ``Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment." *American Political Science Review*](http://www.donaldgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gerber_Green_Larimer-APSR-2008.pdf), 102 (1): 33-48.]

---

## Does Social Pressure Affect Turnout?

We will answer, by analysing data from an experiment where registered voters were randomly assigned to either 

.content-box-yellow[

- (a) receive a message designed to induce social pressure to vote, or
    
- (b) receive nothing
    
]

The message told registered voters that .content-box-yellow[after the election their neighbours would be informed about whether they voted in the election or not].
    
- What to you think the effect might be?


---

- What do we need to calculate to estimate the average causal effect of receiving the message on the probability of turning out to vote?

--

.content-box-red[

.center[the difference-in-means estimator]

]
   
--

- Why does the difference-in-means estimator provide us with a *valid* estimate of the average treatment effect in this case?

--

.content-box-yellow[

- because the data come from a randomised experiment (where treatment was randomly assigned)
    
- as a result, **treatment** and **control** groups are comparable and we can use the factual outcome of one group as a proxy for the counterfactual outcome of the other

]
    
---

- In this case, the **difference-in-means estimator** is:



`$$\overline{voted}_{treatment} - \overline{voted}_{control}$$`
.content-box-purple[

- `\(\overline{voted}_{treatment}\)`: proportion of registered voters who voted among those who received the message

- `\(\overline{voted}_{control}\)`: proportion of registered voters who voted among those who did not receive the message

]

---

## Let's estimate the difference-in-means estimator with R!

### STEP 1. Download the data 

- Download `voting.csv` from Canvas [link](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/59609/files/folder/problem-set-files?preview=37498756)

---

### STEP 2. Load `voting.csv` into R     

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/rstudio-import.gif' width = 70%&gt;]

The RStudio feature "Import Dataset" -&gt; "From Text (base)" will write this code for you (making sure to specify the right path to the file).


``` r
voting &lt;- read.csv("voting.csv") # reads and stores data
```



Now your data is stored in a dataframe object named `voting`
---

### STEP 3. Look at the data


``` r
head(voting) # shows the first six observations
```

```
##   birth message voted
## 1  1981      no     0
## 2  1959      no     1
## 3  1956      no     1
## 4  1939     yes     1
## 5  1968      no     0
## 6  1967      no     0
```

- what does each **observation** represent?
- what is the **outcome** variable?
- what is the **treatment** variable?

---

### STEP 4. Create binary treatment variable

- First, we need to learn how to use `==` and `ifelse()`.

--

- The operator `==`

    + is used to create logical tests that evaluate whether the observations of a variable equal a particular value
    
        + values should be in quotes if text but without quotes if numbers
        
    + examples: 
    
        + `variable == 1` 
        + `variable == yes`

---

- The function `ifelse()`

    - creates the contents of a new variable based on the values of an existing one
    - requires three arguments, separated by commas, in the following order: 
    
       1. logical test (using `==`),
       2. return value if logical test is `TRUE`,
       3. return value if logical test is `FALSE`.

#### Example
       

``` r
ifelse(variable=="yes", 1, 0)
```

    
---

### STEP 5. Create binary treatment variable

#### ifelse on data frame's variables

Using `ifelse()` we can create a new variable (i.e. column) in a data frame with this syntax


``` r
data$new_variable &lt;- 
  ifelse(data$variable == "yes", 1, 0)
```

--

Let's now create a new variable in our data frame


``` r
## create variable pressure inside dataframe voting
voting$pressure &lt;- # stores return values in new variable
  ifelse(voting$message=="yes", # logical test
         1, # return value if logical test is true
         0) # return value if logical test is false
```

--

- You need to run the code all at once (not line by line)
- Remember that R will ignore anything that follows the `#` sign, until the end of the line

---

#### Let's check that everything is OK ...


``` r
head(voting) # shows first observations
```

```
##   birth message voted pressure
## 1  1981      no     0        0
## 2  1959      no     1        0
## 3  1956      no     1        0
## 4  1939     yes     1        1
## 5  1968      no     0        0
## 6  1967      no     0        0
```

- Note that when *message* equals "yes", *pressure* equals 1; and when *message* equals "no", *pressure* equals 0

---

## STEP 6. Compute the difference-in-means estimator

`$$\overline{Y}_{treatment} - \overline{Y}_{control}$$`
We use the letter `\(Y\)` which conventionally denotes the **outcome** (a.k.a. **dependent**) variable.


- `\(\overline{Y}_{treatment}\)`: average outcome for the treatment group
- `\(\overline{Y}_{control}\)`: average outcome for the control group


- In the voting experiment:

`\(\overline{voted}_{treatment} - \overline{voted}_{control}\)`

+ `\(\overline{voted}_{treatment}\)`: mean of *voted* for treatment group
+ `\(\overline{voted}_{control}\)`: mean of *voted* for control group

---

- Let's start by practising computing and interpreting means (with the function `mean()`)


``` r
mean(voting$voted) # calculates the mean of voted
```

```
## [1] 0.3101759
```

- Interpretation?
    + 31% of *all* the registered voters who were part of the experiment voted
    
- Why in %?
    + Because *voted* is binary
    + Recall: The mean of a binary variable should be interpreted in \% (after multiplying the output by 100)

---

### Now, how do we estimate the difference-in-means estimator?

- `mean(voting$voted` computes the mean of *voted* for all the observations in the dataset (that is, for all the registered voters in the experiment)

- To compute the difference-in-means estimator, we need to calculate the mean of *voted* for subsets of observations

- Specifically, we need to compute:

    + the mean of *voted* for the treatment group, that is, for the observations that were treated (for which *pressure* equals 1)
    
    + the mean of *voted* for the control group, that is, for the observations that were not treated (for which *pressure* equals 0)

- To do this, we need to learn how to use the `[]` operator

---

- Operator `[]`:

  - extracts a selection of observations from a variable
  - to its left, we specify the variable we want to subset
  - inside the square brackets, we specify the criteria of selection (for example, we can specify a logical test using the relational operator `==`)
    
Example:


``` r
data$var1[data$var2==1] ## Don't run
```
    
  - extracts the observations of the variable `var1` for which the variable `var2` equals 1
  
---

#### Let's Compute the mean of *voted* for treatment and control groups


``` r
mean(voting$voted[voting$pressure==1]) # treatment
```

```
## [1] 0.3779482
```

``` r
mean(voting$voted[voting$pressure==0]) # control
```

```
## [1] 0.2966383
```

.content-box-green[

- Interpretation of the first mean?
    + 30% of the registered voters who did *not* receive the message voted (30x100=30%)
    
- Interpretation of the second mean?
    + 38% of the registered voters who received the message voted (38x100=38%)
    
]
    
---

#### Now, we can compute the difference-in-means estimator as the difference between the two means above:


``` r
mean(voting$voted[voting$pressure==1]) - 
  mean(voting$voted[voting$pressure==0]) 
```

```
## [1] 0.08130991
```

Direction, size, and unit of measurement of the effect?

--

- increase of 8 percentage points

--

- *increase* because we are measuring a change in `\(Y\)` and the number is positive

--

- *percentage points* because it is the result of subtracting two percentages: %-% = p.p. (because *voted* is binary)

--

- *8* (and not 0.08) because we need to multiply the number by 100 to turn it into p.p. (because *voted* is binary)

--

- 38% - 30% = 8 p.p.

---

## STEP 7. Write conclusion statement

- What's the assumption we are making when estimating the average causal effect? 
    + registered voters who received the message are comparable to registered voters who did not

- Why is this a reasonable assumption?
    + data comes from a randomized experiment
    
- What's the treatment? 
    + receiving the message inducing social `pressure`

- What's the **outcome** (a.k.a. **dependent variable**)? 
    + probability of voting

- What's the direction, size, and unit of measurement of the average causal effect?
    + an increase of 8 percentage points, on average

---
