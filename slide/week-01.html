## Your teacher
	
Francesco Bailo (francesco.bailo@sydney.edu.au)

I am a Lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Sydney. I am also the [Deputy Director of the Centre for AI, Trust and Governance](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/our-research/centres-institutes-and-groups/centre-for-ai-trust-and-governance.html).

I am interested in researching forms of political engagement and political talk on social media. I researched the emergence and dynamics of online communities, the role between news organisations and social media, and the interdependence between social media activists and news organisations. I have engaged with and applied quantitative research methods developing expertise in quantitative text analysis (NLP) and network analysis.

This year I am teaching GOVT6139 (S2), SSPS4102 &amp; SSPS6006 (S1) and GOVT3901 (S1).

# What Students Liked

### 💬 Student Quotes
&gt; _"This unit was incredibly helpful with statistical literacy. I feel much more comfortable interpreting statistics and discussing these concepts."_

&gt; _"Francesco was a very supportive tutor who was always willing to help us as much as he could. His positive attitude was possibly the only thing that kept me going through this subject, as it was very hard."_

&gt; _"Learning how to code is important, so I have enjoyed learning this. The structure of class and the R-Studio quizzes were helpful."_

&gt; _"I enjoyed learning how to use a new program, despite the difficulties of it. I also quite enjoyed the assessment tasks."_

&gt; _"This has been an entirely new skill for me to develop, which was useful and applicable within the workforce."_

✅ **Overall:** A challenging but rewarding unit that helped students build essential data analytics skills with strong teaching support.

---

# What students didn't like: Areas for Improvement

1. **Course Pace &amp; Difficulty** – The fast pace was challenging.

2. **Class Structure &amp; Timing** – The 3-hour seminar format was considered long and difficult to stay engaged in.

3. **Coding Integration** – Students suggested better integration between code and theory (statistical but also research design theory).

# Content

This unit will introduce you (gently!) to 

1. computer programming with R, a language for [statistical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics).

2. concepts for data analysis and its practice using R.

## Learning goal in a nutshell

To analyse data different kinds of data (multivariate but also textual, network and spatial) to

1. Measure;

2. Explain; 

3. Predict.

---

# How to learn data analysis + coding (1/2)

* The challenge in this unit is that on top of learning data analysis concepts, you also need to learn to code with R... 

* but this is an opportunity:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; data analysis concepts are always and immediately applied to data using R.

.center[&lt;img src="../img/coding-with-fire.gif" style="width: 60%" /&gt;]

.footnote[
[1] Of course, it is! This is very much a *feature* of the unit, not a *bug*!
]

---

# How to learn data analysis + coding (2/2)

Focus on

1. understanding (and communicating your understanding) of all the data analysis concepts;

2. understanding how to apply these concepts to your data with R;

3. developing a *functional* understanding of R - don' try to understand everything R does (or does not) for you!

# Why R?

---

# Why R?

* Along with Python, R is the most popular language for data manipulation, analysis and reporting. 

* R is more popular with *social* scientists while Python is more popular with *computer* scientists.

* R is open-source [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software). Everybody can use it and modify it. Its community is huge and constantly contributing new packages, features and documentation to the software. Likely, there is at least one package and a vignette to facilitate what you plan to do with your data. 

* RStudio, an excellent [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for R, is also free. 

* R deals well with large, complex data sets.

---

# No-code / low-code software alternatives for data analysis (1/2)

* **Spreadsheet (Excel et al)**: Easy to access (likely your university or employer will give you access to it) and effective and intuitive for manipulating tabular data but limited in 
  * the type of analysis and visualisation they allow (e.g., no out-of-the-box linear regression 🙍);
  * the "shape" of data they can read: it can only be a table with rows and columns (i.e, no [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) data);
  * the size of the data they can read.
  
---

# No-code / low-code software alternatives for data analysis (2/2)
  
* **SPSS**: Sophisticated and easy to learn (yet, not that easy) but expensive. It is virtually only used in academia. Some limitation in terms of analytical tool (e.g. network and text analysis with additionally purchased software) 

* **Tableau**: Mostly focused on data visualisation. Very popular in the industry for business intelligence. Relatively expensive and limited in terms of analytical tool (e.g. no network or text analysis).

* **Power BI**: Mostly focused on data visualisation. Popular in the industry for business intelligence but less popular than Tableau. Relatively expensive and limited in terms of analytical tool (e.g. no network or text analysis).

# Getting started with R (and RStudio)

---

## What is the relation between R and RStudio?

**R** is the computer language that we use to set the instructions (our *code*). For example,


``` r
x &lt;- 42
```

is the R syntax to tell the computer to assign (`&lt;-`) the numerical *value* `42` to the (variable) name `x`. The result of this line of code is either to change the value of `x` to `42` or to create a new variable in the current *environment*, name it `x` and assign to it the value `42`.

---

**RStudio** is an [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) to facilitate (among other tasks)

* writing and debug R code (but other syntaxes such as Python are also supported), 
* run it,
* keep an eye on the objects (i.e. *data* and *values*) in my *environment*,
* import datasets,
* visualise plots,
* navigate local files,
* install packages.

---

## RStudio

.pull-left[

After launching RStudio, you should see four windows. Each windows has a number of tabs (like in a web browser). The most important tabs are:

]

.pull-right[

.center[&lt;img src="../img/rstudio-ui.svg" style="width: 100%" /&gt;]

]

1. **Upper-left window**: Your *code*. Each code file you have open appears in a different tab. 
2. **Upper-right window**: All the objects - *data* (e.g. dataframes), *values* (of your *variables*) and *functions* loaded in your environment are listed here. 
3. **Lower-right window**: Your local *files* and *plots* can be accessed from here. 
4. **Lower-left window**:  The *console*. Your R code will execute here. Code output (including errors and messages) is visualised here.

## Running R code with RStudio (1/2)

There are two ways to run R code with RStudio:

1. You can execute lines from your **R source code** as they appear in the upper-left window:

    a. To execute a single line of code place your cursor on that line and hit the "Run" toolbar button.
    
    b. To execute more than one line, select these line in your R source code and hit the "Run" toolbar button.

## Installing and loading packages

One of the best features of R is its community of contributors and developers.

There are 19,164 packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), the main repository. But if we include other repositories, e.g. GitHub, the number of packages is significantly larger.

No matter what you need to do, it is very likely that an R package out there can help you!

If you have succesfully installed R, you can start adding new packages to your R installation simply using the function `install.packages()`.

---

For example, if you want to install ggplot2 you can 


``` r
install.packages('ggplot2')
```

Once you have installed your package you can load it with


``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

Note: this time without quotes!

# Let's start coding...

## Creating your first R object

This R code


``` r
hello &lt;- "hi"
```

will do two things. 

1. It will create a new *object* called `hello`;

2. and it will assign to that object the value `"hi"`.

If you run it, well done! You just created your first variable. 

.center[&lt;img src ="https://media.giphy.com/media/jJQC2puVZpTMO4vUs0/giphy.gif" width = '30%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## Objects? What objects?

R is an object-oriented programming language. 

So everything in R, code or data, is some type of object. When you have an object in your environment (check your top-right window in RStudio) you can ask R to specify what type of object with the function `class()`. 


``` r
class(hello)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

---

## Functions (1/2)

Another very common and important type of object in R is the **function**.

Yes, a function is also an object!


``` r
class(class)
```

```
## [1] "function"
```

While programming in R, you will eventually create your own functions. More commonly you will use functions available in R base or in one of the packages you have loaded in your session.

You can use a function with


``` r
package::function_name(arguments) # Don't run this!
```

---

## Functions (2/2)


``` r
package::function_name(arguments) # Don't run this!
```

* `package::` prefix is optional and names the package defining the function you want to use (essential only if you have functions from different packages sharing the same name, important to tell others which package they need to install to run the function).

* `arguments` will of course varies depending on the function. Some arguments can be as default in the function definition so they are optional.

A function may or may not produce an output. To store an output from a function 


``` r
my_variable &lt;- function_name(arguments) # Don't run this!
```


---

## Loading data (1/2)

R requires all data to be loaded in memory for processing. There are many way to load data and a number of packages offer functions to read in from virtually any format you will ever encounter - from the most common (.csv or .xls) to the rarest. 

If your data was already stored as some collection of R objects, you will likely encounter a data file with the extension **.RData**. You load everything stored in a .RData file with the function `load("mydata.RData")`.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  

Wait, why the quotation mark? The `load()` function requires a `character` value indicating the path to the file on your computer. Yet, when you load a package with `library(package_name)` you refer to an object of the R environment by its name - so no quotes!  


.footnote[
[1] Another less common data format is *.Rds* which instead stores a *single* R object. 
]

---

## Loading data (2/2)

Very often you will need to read data from a spreadsheet. If your data is in a *comma separated values* format, you can use the base function `read.csv("my-file.csv")` - notably your file can be on your computer but can also be somewhere on the Internet. 

For example try this


``` r
cities &lt;- 
  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraba/SSPS4102/master/data/cities.csv")
```

---

## Making sense of data objects

Data can come in many different *types* (or *classes*) of objects. Among the most common data "shapes" are *vectors* and *matrices*.

Vectors are values of the same type (e.g. `numeric`, `character`) combined together (with `c()`) in a precise order


``` r
#   [1]       [2].     [3]  #
c("first", "second", "third")
```

```
## [1] "first"  "second" "third"
```

If we *bind* vectors of the same type and of the same lenght, by columns with `cbind()` or by rows `rbind()`, we create a rectangular-shaped data object called a `matrix`. 

A special type of matrix is the `data.frame` in which each column - we refer to a data frame column as *variables* - can be a vector of a different type (e.g. `character` and `numeric`).

---

## Measuring data objects (1/2)

A vector is a one-dimensional data object: it only has a lenght! We measure the length of a vector with `length()`


``` r
length(c("first", "second", "third"))
```

```
## [1] 3
```

A `matrix` and its buddy the `data.frame` instead have two dimensions: *rows* and *columns*.

Conveniently, the `read.csv()` function will import the data of spreadsheet into a `data.frame` object. If you run it before you should now able to get 


``` r
class(cities)
```

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```

---

## Measuring data objects (2/2)

To measure the size of a `matrix` or `data.frame`, you can use `dim()`, `nrow()` or `ncol`. 


``` r
dim(cities)
```

```
## [1] 128  10
```

will detail both dimensions at once while 


``` r
ncol(cities)
```

```
## [1] 10
```

``` r
nrow(cities)
```

```
## [1] 128
```

respectively the number of columns and the number of rows.

---

## RStudio project (1/2)

(A more expansive documentation on RStudio project is available [here on Canvas](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/49127/modules/items/1865380).)

To effectively complete your tasks (the three assignments but also the weekly problem sets) you want to familiarise yourself with **RStudio projects**.

**RStudio projects** facilitate working with R code and data files. But they also greatly facilitate sharing your projects with others (when submitting your assignments, you are required to also upload the compressed folder of your project).

An RStudio project is located in a dedicated folder on your computer and that folder will also be the working directory, when you open a project in your *R session*. 

There are two key files linked to your project and placed in your project folder:

1. The file "[name-of-your-project].Rproj" contains the metadata about your project (this is a small file);

2. The file ".RData" (no file name, just the extension ".RData") contains all the objects of your environment and is loaded/saved when you open/close your project.
