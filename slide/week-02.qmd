# Worked Example: Australian Elections (Slides from Week 01)

## Putting it all together

Let's walk through the complete workflow with a real example:

**Question**: How many seats did each party win in the 2022 Australian Federal Election?

. . .

::: callout-tip
### The workflow

1.  **Plan**: Sketch the data and graph we need
2.  **Simulate**: Create fake data to test our approach
3.  **Acquire**: Get the real data
4.  **Explore**: Analyse and visualise
5.  **Share**: Communicate our findings
:::

## Step 1: Plan

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Data we need**:

| Division | Party   |
|----------|---------|
| Adelaide | Labor   |
| Aston    | Liberal |
| ...      | ...     |
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Graph we want**:

A bar chart showing the number of seats won by each party.
:::
:::::

::: notes
In practice, you'd sketch these by hand on paper.
:::

## Step 2: Simulate

```{r}
# Create simulated data
simulated_data <- tibble(
  division = 1:151,  # 151 seats in the House
  party = sample(
    x = c("Liberal", "Labor", "Nationals", "Greens", "Other"),
    size = 151,
    replace = TRUE
  )
)

# Check the first few rows
head(simulated_data)
```

## Step 3: Acquire

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Read data from the Australian Electoral Commission
raw_elections_data <- read_csv(
  file = paste0(
    "https://results.aec.gov.au/27966/website/Downloads/",
    "HouseMembersElectedDownload-27966.csv"
  ),
  skip = 1
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# For the slides, we'll simulate the cleaned data
cleaned_elections_data <- tibble(
  division = c("Adelaide", "Aston", "Ballarat", "Banks", "Barker", "Barton",
               "Bass", "Bean", "Bendigo", "Bennelong"),
  elected_party = c("Labor", "Liberal", "Labor", "Liberal", "Liberal", 
                    "Labor", "Labor", "Labor", "Labor", "Liberal")
)

# Simulate full dataset for the plot
set.seed(2022)
full_data <- tibble(
  division = paste0("Division_", 1:151),
  elected_party = sample(
    c(rep("Labor", 77), rep("Liberal", 48), rep("Nationals", 10),
      rep("Greens", 4), rep("Other", 12))
  )
)
```

## Step 4: Explore — Counting seats

```{r}
# Count seats by party
full_data |>
  count(elected_party) |>
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## Step 4: Explore — Creating a graph

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5
full_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = elected_party)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#00539b") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +
  labs(
    x = "Party",
    y = "Number of seats",
    title = "2022 Australian Federal Election Results"
  )
```

## Step 5: Share

> Australia is a parliamentary democracy with 151 seats in the House of Representatives. The 2022 Federal Election saw the Labor Party win 77 seats, followed by the Liberal Party with 48 seats.

**Key findings**:

-   Labor won a majority (77 seats)
-   The two major parties dominate
-   Minor parties and independents won 26 seats combined

# Why Reproducibility Matters

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. Create reproducible documents with Quarto
2. Organise projects using R Projects
3. Use Git and GitHub for version control
4. Import data from various file formats

::: notes
These skills form the foundation of professional data analysis workflows.
:::

## What is reproducibility?

::: callout-note
### Definition

**Reproducibility** means that everything you did—all of it, end-to-end—can be independently redone by someone else.
:::

. . .

This includes:

- Getting the same data
- Running the same code
- Producing the same results
- Understanding the same decisions

## Why does reproducibility matter?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**For science**:

- Enables verification
- Builds trust in findings
- Allows others to extend your work
- Required by many journals
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**For you**:

- Future you is "someone else"
- Makes collaboration easier
- Catches errors early
- Professional standard
:::
:::

::: aside
From Alexander (2023), *Telling Stories with Data*
:::

## The reproducibility crisis

Many published findings cannot be reproduced:

- Psychology: ~40% of studies replicate
- Cancer biology: ~10-25% replicate
- Economics: ~50% replicate

. . .

::: callout-warning
### The problem

Poor documentation, lost data, and undocumented decisions make it impossible to verify or build on previous work.
:::

## Components of reproducible research

1. **Code** — Scripts that transform data into results
2. **Data** — Raw and processed datasets
3. **Environment** — Software versions and dependencies
4. **Documentation** — Explanations of decisions and methods

. . .

> "The use of projects is required to meet the minimal level of reproducibility expected of credible work."

# Quarto: Literate Programming

## What is Quarto?

::: callout-note
### Definition

**Quarto** integrates code and natural language in a way called "literate programming". It combines text, code, and output in a single document.
:::

. . .

Key features:

- Successor to R Markdown
- Works with R, Python, Julia, and more
- Produces HTML, PDF, Word, slides, websites
- Free and open source

::: aside
From Alexander (2023), Chapter 3
:::

## Why use Quarto?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages**:

- "Live" documents where code executes
- Single source, multiple outputs
- Consistent formatting
- Easy to update
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**For this course**:

- Professional standard
- Combines analysis and writing
- Makes work shareable
- Required for assignments
:::
:::

## Creating a Quarto document

In RStudio:

1. **File** → **New File** → **Quarto Document...**
2. Add a title and your name
3. Unclick "Use visual markdown editor" (for now)
4. Click **Create**

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Two editing modes

- **Source**: See the raw markup
- **Visual**: WYSIWYG editing (like Word)

Start with Source to learn the syntax!
:::

## The structure of a Quarto document

A Quarto document has three parts:

1. **YAML header** — Document settings (between `---`)
2. **Markdown text** — Your written content
3. **Code chunks** — Executable R code

```{verbatim}
---
title: "My Analysis"
author: "Your Name"
format: html
---

# Introduction

Some text here.

```{r}
1 + 1
```
```

## YAML header basics

The YAML header controls document settings:

```yaml
---
title: "My document"
author: "Rohan Alexander"
date: today
format: html
---
```

. . .

Common options:

- `title`, `author`, `date` — Document metadata
- `format: html` or `format: pdf` — Output type
- `abstract` — Summary text

## Adding references

Include a bibliography file in the YAML:

```yaml
---
title: "My document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

. . .

Then cite in your text:

- `@citeR` produces: R Core Team (2023)
- `[@citeR]` produces: (R Core Team 2023)

::: callout-tip
### Finding citations

Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) or [doi2bib](https://www.doi2bib.org) to get BibTeX entries.
:::

## Essential Markdown commands

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Emphasis**:

- `*italic*` → *italic*
- `**bold**` → **bold**

**Headers**:

```
# First level
## Second level
### Third level
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Lists**:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  + Sub-item
```

**Links**:

```
[text](https://url.com)
```
:::
:::

::: notes
The Markdown Quick Reference in RStudio (Help menu) is very useful.
:::

## Code chunks

Code chunks contain R code that will execute:

````{verbatim}
```{r}
# Calculate the mean of some numbers
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```
````

. . .

Produces:

```{r}
# Calculate the mean of some numbers
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

## Chunk options

Control how chunks behave with special comments:

````{verbatim}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
```
````

. . .

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `echo: false` | Hide the code, show output |
| `eval: false` | Show code, don't run it |
| `include: false` | Run code, hide everything |
| `warning: false` | Suppress warnings |
| `message: false` | Suppress messages |

## Example: Including a graph

````{verbatim}
```{r}
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: "A simple scatterplot"
#| echo: false

mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```
````

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-actual
#| fig-cap: "A simple scatterplot"
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = "#00539b") +
  labs(x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles per gallon") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

## Cross-references

Reference figures and tables by their label:

- Figures: `@fig-labelname` → Figure 1
- Tables: `@tbl-labelname` → Table 1
- Equations: `@eq-labelname` → Equation 1

. . .

::: callout-important
### Naming convention

Labels must start with the type prefix:

- `fig-` for figures
- `tbl-` for tables
- `eq-` for equations
:::

## Rendering your document

Click the **Render** button (or press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K`)

. . .

This will:

1. Run all the R code
2. Convert Markdown to formatted text
3. Produce the output document

::: callout-warning
### Common error

The Quarto document must be self-contained. Objects in your R environment are **not** automatically available—you must load data within the document.

# R Projects and File Structure

## Why use R Projects?

::: callout-important
### The problem with `setwd()`

Using `setwd("C:/Users/yourname/Documents/project/")` means:

- Your code won't work on anyone else's computer
- Your code won't work if you move the folder
- Your code won't work on a different operating system
:::

. . .

**R Projects solve this** by making all file paths relative to the project folder.

## What is an R Project?

An R Project is a folder with a special `.Rproj` file that tells RStudio:

- This is a project
- Set the working directory here
- Keep project-specific settings

. . .

> "The use of R Projects enables 'reliable, polite behavior across different computers or users and over time'."

::: aside
Bryan and Hester (2020)
:::

## Creating an R Project

In RStudio:

1. **File** → **New Project...**
2. Select **New Directory** or **Existing Directory**
3. Give it a meaningful name
4. Click **Create Project**

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Good project names

- Use lowercase
- No spaces (use underscores or hyphens)
- Be descriptive: `australian_elections_2022`
:::

## Recommended folder structure

```

## Folder structure explained

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**inputs/**

- Raw, unedited data
- Never overwrite these!
- Related literature/PDFs

**outputs/**

- Data you create
- Your paper/report
- Figures and tables

::: {.column width="50%"}
**scripts/**

- R scripts for each step
- Numbered for order
- Transform inputs → outputs

**README.md**

- Overview of the project
- How to run the code
- Data sources
:::
:::

## The README file

Every project needs a README that explains:

1. What the project is about
2. How the files are organised
3. How to reproduce the analysis
4. Where the data came from

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Template

Use the [Social Science Data Editors template](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/) as a starting point.
:::

# Reading and Writing Data in R

## The working directory

Your **working directory** is where R looks for files by default.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Check your working directory
getwd()

# Set working directory (avoid this!)
setwd("path/to/folder")
```

. . .

::: callout-warning
### Don't use `setwd()`!

With R Projects, the working directory is automatically set to the project folder. Using `setwd()` breaks reproducibility.
:::

## Reading CSV files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is the most common data format:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Base R
data <- read.csv("inputs/data/mydata.csv")

# Tidyverse (recommended)
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("inputs/data/mydata.csv")
```

. . .

::: callout-note
### `read_csv()` vs `read.csv()`

`read_csv()` from the tidyverse is faster and handles data types better. We'll use it throughout this course.
:::

## Reading other file types

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Tab-separated files
data <- read_tsv("data.tsv")

# Files with other delimiters
data <- read_delim("data.txt", delim = "|")

# Excel files (need readxl package)
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("data.xlsx")

# Space-separated (base R)
data <- read.table("data.txt", header = TRUE)
```

## The `header` argument

Many data files have column names in the first row:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# First row contains column names
data <- read.table("data.txt", header = TRUE)

# First row is data (no column names)
data <- read.table("data.txt", header = FALSE)
```

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Tidyverse default

`read_csv()` assumes `header = TRUE` by default—one less thing to remember!
:::

## Writing data

Save your processed data:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Save as CSV (tidyverse)
write_csv(cleaned_data, "outputs/data/cleaned_data.csv")

# Save as CSV (base R)
write.csv(cleaned_data, "outputs/data/cleaned_data.csv")

# Save R object (preserves data types)
saveRDS(cleaned_data, "outputs/data/cleaned_data.rds")
```

## Examining your data

After loading data, always check it:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# First few rows
head(data)

# Last few rows
tail(data)

# Structure and types
str(data)

# Dimensions
nrow(data)  # Number of rows
ncol(data)  # Number of columns
dim(data)   # Both

# Column names
names(data)
```

## Example: Reading and examining data

```{r}
# Create some example data
example_data <- tibble(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35),
  score = c(85.5, 92.0, 78.5)
)

# Examine it
head(example_data)
```

```{r}
names(example_data)
```

## Accessing columns

Two ways to access a column:

```{r}
# Using $ notation
example_data$age
```

```{r}
# Using bracket notation
example_data[, "age"]
```

)
```


# More R Basics

## Vectors

A **vector** is a list of items of the same type:

```{r}
# Create vectors
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol")

# Sequences
1:10
seq(0, 100, by = 10)
```

## Operations on vectors

Mathematical operations work element-by-element:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(10, 20, 30)

x + y    # Addition
x * y    # Multiplication
x^2      # Power
```

## Summarising vectors

```{r}
values <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

sum(values)      # Total
mean(values)     # Average
length(values)   # Count
```

## Missing values

R represents missing data as `NA`:

```{r}
data_with_missing <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)

# Many functions return NA if data contains NA
mean(data_with_missing)

# Use na.rm = TRUE to ignore missing values
mean(data_with_missing, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Subsetting with brackets

Access specific elements with `[ ]`:

```{r}
letters_example <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")

letters_example[1]        # First element
letters_example[c(1, 3)]  # First and third
letters_example[2:4]      # Second through fourth
```

## Logical comparisons

```{r}
x <- 5

x > 3   # Greater than
x == 5  # Equal to (note: two equals signs!)
x != 3  # Not equal to
x <= 5  # Less than or equal to
```

. . .

::: callout-warning
### Common mistake

`=` is assignment, `==` is comparison!

- `x = 5` assigns the value 5 to x
- `x == 5` asks "is x equal to 5?"

# Version Control with Git and GitHub <br> (This part is advanced we will only skimmed through it)

## Why version control?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**The old way**:

- `analysis.R`
- `analysis_v2.R`
- `analysis_final.R`
- `analysis_final_FINAL.R`
- `analysis_final_FINAL_v2.R`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Git way**:

- `analysis.R`
- + history of all changes
- + messages explaining changes
- + ability to go back
:::
:::

## What is Git?

::: callout-note
### Definition

**Git** is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It keeps snapshots of your project that you can return to.
:::

. . .

Key concepts:

- **Repository (repo)**: A project folder tracked by Git
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a point in time
- **History**: The record of all commits

## What is GitHub?

::: callout-note
### Definition

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories online. It makes it easy to share code, collaborate, and back up your work.
:::

. . .

Think of it as:

- **Git** = Track changes locally
- **GitHub** = Share and back up to the cloud

## Setting up Git

Check if Git is installed (in Terminal):

```bash
git --version
```

. . .

Configure your identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

::: callout-important
### Use your real details

These appear in your commit history and should match your GitHub account.
:::

## Creating a GitHub account

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Create a free account
3. Choose a professional username

## Alternatively you can access the enterprise GitHub site of the University of Sydney using your UniKey

1. Go to [github.sydney.edu.au](https://github.sydney.edu.au)
2. Activate your account using your UniKey and password.

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Username advice

Your username becomes part of your professional profile. Choose something:

- Professional
- Related to your name
- Easy to remember
:::

## The Git workflow

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 2.5

workflow <- tibble(
  step = factor(c("Pull", "Work", "Stage", "Commit", "Push"),
                levels = c("Pull", "Work", "Stage", "Commit", "Push")),
  x = 1:5,
  y = 1
)

ggplot(workflow, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 15, colour = "#00539b") +
  geom_text(aes(label = step), colour = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x + 0.3, xend = x + 0.7, y = y, yend = y),
               data = workflow |> filter(x < 5),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")),
               colour = "#00539b", linewidth = 1) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.5, 5.5))
```

1. **Pull**: Get the latest version from GitHub
2. **Work**: Make your changes
3. **Stage**: Select files to include in the snapshot
4. **Commit**: Take the snapshot with a message
5. **Push**: Upload to GitHub

## Using Git in RStudio

RStudio has a Git pane that makes this easier:

1. **Pull** (blue down arrow): Get changes from GitHub
2. **Stage** (checkbox): Select files to commit
3. **Commit** (button): Open commit window
4. **Push** (green up arrow): Send to GitHub

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Start with Pull

Always pull before you start working to get any changes.
:::

## Writing good commit messages

A commit message should explain *what* changed and *why*:

```
Add graphs to data section

- Added unemployment line chart
- Added inflation bar chart
- Updated figure references in text
```

. . .

### Commit regularly

Frequent, small commits are better than rare, large ones. They make it easier to find and fix problems.
:::

## The `.gitignore` file

Some files should **not** be tracked:

- Large data files (>100MB)
- Sensitive information
- Temporary files
- System files (`.DS_Store`)

. . .

List these in a `.gitignore` file:

```
# Ignore data files
*.csv
data/

# Ignore system files
.DS_Store
```

## Connecting RStudio to GitHub

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub
2. In R, run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install packages if needed
install.packages(c("usethis", "gitcreds"))

# Create a PAT (opens GitHub in browser)
usethis::create_github_token()

# Save your PAT
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

::: callout-warning
### Keep your PAT secret

Never include your PAT in any R script or document!
:::

## Starting a new project with Git

**Option 1**: Create on GitHub first

1. Create new repo on GitHub
2. Copy the URL
3. In RStudio: File → New Project → Version Control → Git
4. Paste URL and create

. . .

**Option 2**: Create locally first

```{r}
#| eval: false
# After creating an R Project
usethis::use_git()      # Initialise Git
usethis::use_github()   # Create GitHub repo
```

## Don't panic!

::: callout-tip
### Git can be confusing

> "It is normal to be intimidated by Git and GitHub. Many data scientists only know a little about how to use it, and that is okay."

The key commands are: **pull**, **commit**, **push**.

Everything else can be learned as needed!

# Putting It All Together

## A reproducible workflow

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
### Setup (once)

1. Create GitHub repo
2. Clone as R Project
3. Set up folder structure
4. Create README

### Each session

1. **Pull** from GitHub
2. Write code in scripts
3. Document in Quarto
4. **Commit** with message
5. **Push** to GitHub
:::
